# Cognitive Load Theory

*Current thought:*
In VR, "Interface" is everything. The environment *is* the UI.

## Intrinsic vs Extraneous

- **Intrinsic**: The difficulty of the task itself (e.g., solving a puzzle).
- **Extraneous**: The difficulty of using the tools (e.g., struggling with controller mapping).

**Goal**: Minimize extraneous load to near zero so the user can focus on the intrinsic experience.

### Questions
- How does haptic feedback reduce visual load?
- Can audio cues replace UI elements?
