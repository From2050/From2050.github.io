## The Problem

Smooth locomotion in VR often causes motion sickness. Teleportation breaks immersion.

## The Experiment

 I'm building a system that uses **arm-swinging** gestures to drive forward movement. It mimics natural walking mechanics, potentially reducing the sensory mismatch.

### Status
- [x] Basic Three.js scene
- [x] Controller input mapping
- [ ] Physics integration

Check back for the interactive demo component!
